## Recommendations

### Low-Use Database (Action Required)

**Daily Standups** (1 entry)
- Created: 2026-02-01
- Last edit: 2026-02-01
- **Recommendation:** This database may be redundant. Consider:
  1. Merging with "Agent Status" database
  2. Archiving if the standup format has changed
  3. Populating with more entries if the process is continuing

### Workspace Optimization Suggestions

1. **Standardize Naming:** Some databases use emojis (📋, 📊) while others don't. Consider consistent naming conventions.

2. **Database Grouping:** The workspace contains two distinct categories:
   - **Agent Operations** (Daily Standups, Agent Status, Projects, Tasks)
   - **Turo/Vehicle Business** (Issues, Inquiries, Monthly Reports, Weekly Reports, Experiments, KPI Tracker, Bookings)
   
   Consider organizing into separate pages or workspaces if these represent different business units.

3. **Regular Audits:** Schedule quarterly audits to maintain workspace hygiene.
