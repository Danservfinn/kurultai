# Memory Log - 2026-02-10

## Signal Integration Stabilization

**Morning:**
- Signal account (+15165643945) had recurring config lock issues
- Multiple daemon restarts required throughout day
- Deployed comprehensive fix: signal-daemon-service.sh with auto-restart
- Hourly test cron job created to monitor stability

**Resolution:**
- Created 3 management scripts in tools/
- Auto-detects config locks and restarts daemon
- 5-minute cooldown prevents restart loops
- Service now stable

## Jochi Health Check Enhancement - COMPLETE

**Major Implementation:**
- All 7 phases implemented (16 hours of work)
- 11 new files, 3400+ lines of code
- 7 health check modules:
  - Signal health monitoring
  - System resources (disk, memory, CPU)
  - Neo4j performance
  - Agent deep dive
  - Task queue monitoring
  - Security health
  - External API health
- Full test suite
- Integrated with agent_tasks.py
- Committed: c4a244e

## Implementation Reality Check

**Golden-horde analysis revealed:**
- Actual completion: ~72% (not 98% as previously thought)
- Critical gaps remain in:
  - JavaScript workflow modules
  - Full curation query set (15 planned, 4 implemented)
  - Kurultai v0.3 features
- Report generated: docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_REPORT.md

## Skills Infrastructure

**Installed:**
- All 68 skills from kurultai-skills repo
- Installed into Claude Code
- Includes: horde-implement, horde-debug, senior roles, C-suite advisors

**Started Integration:**
- x-research skill (X/Twitter research via Composio)
- Requires Bun runtime and Composio API key
- Free tier: 20K calls/month

## Active Subagents

Multiple subagent sessions running:
- horde-implement for health check (completed)
- horde-debug for Signal issues (completed)
- coding-agent for skill installation (completed)

## Key Decisions

1. **Signal Management:** Moved from manual fixes to automated service with monitoring
2. **Health Checks:** Comprehensive 7-domain monitoring now active
3. **Documentation:** Created detailed implementation plans and status reports
4. **Testing:** Hourly automated Signal tests with auto-fix on failure

## Next Steps

- Monitor Signal stability over next 24h
- Complete x-research skill setup
- Address identified implementation gaps (72% → 100%)
- Document lessons learned from Signal issues
